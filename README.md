Simple ttrockstars cheat that automatically joins the next game.
Use for getting a shit ton of score.

## How to use
1. log in to ttrockstars
2. click "multiplayer"
3. click "festival" (works on most other gamemodes but some use different class names and I can't be asked)
4. open dev tools (CTL+SHIFT+I)
5. go to "console" tab
6. paste script in

## Settings
by changing the number on the last line (by default 225) you can change what the delay between answering is. 
NOTE: at least for my pc and internet, 225 is the lowest i can use without being kicked out (i doubt it's an anti cheating measure, probably just a rate limit
