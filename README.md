# Fair-Gameplay
Simple ttrockstars cheat that automatically joins the next game.
Use for getting a shit ton of score.

## How to use
1. Log in to ttrockstars
2. Click "multiplayer"
3. Click "festival" (works on most other gamemodes but some use different class names and I can't be asked)
4. Open dev tools (CTL+SHIFT+I)
5. Go to "console" tab
6. Paste script (fair-gameplay-v2.js)

## Settings
By changing the number on the last line (by default 225) you can change what the delay between answering is. 
NOTE: at least for my pc and internet, 225 is the lowest i can use without being kicked out (i doubt it's an anti cheating measure, probably just a rate limit

## FAQ
Will this work with grease/tampermonkey?
There is no reason why it won't.
